## Billy Trend  

#### Interests

---

I'm fascinated by everything computer related. I've been developing websites since I was ten and I am now very competent in making complex interactive web applications. I'm very excited and optimistic about the future of technology.

I'm currently looking to engage with problems which have wider reach so that I can prove my skills in real-life, large scale environments.

#### Experience

---

I have programming experience in **javascript** (browser and server), **java**, **python**, **Haskell** and **C**.

I am also used to using ancillary development tools such as libraries in all the above languages and their respective package managers; build tools such as **make**, **gulp** and **grunt**; version control systems **git**, **mercurial** and **subversion**; packaging systems **NPM**, **Pip** and **Cabal**; databases **SQL** and **MongoDB**; **Unix**-like operating systems **linux** and **OS X**; markup languages **markdown**, **html/css** and **latex**.
